# Backtesting Engine

## Overview
The Backtesting Engine is a Python-based framework designed to facilitate the testing of trading strategies against historical data. It provides a structured approach to evaluate the performance of various strategies, enabling traders and developers to refine their methods before deploying them in live markets.

## Installation
To set up the Backtesting Engine, you need to create a conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

After the environment is created, activate it with:

```
conda activate backtesting-engine
```

## Usage
To use the Backtesting Engine, you can import the `Backtester` class from the `backtesting` module in your scripts. Here is a simple example:

```python
from src.backtesting import Backtester

# Initialize the backtester
backtester = Backtester()

# Run a backtest
results = backtester.run_backtest(strategy, data)

# Evaluate performance
performance = backtester.evaluate_performance(results)
```

## Testing
Unit tests for the Backtesting Engine are located in the `tests` directory. You can run the tests using a testing framework like `pytest`. To install `pytest`, add it to your `requirements.txt` and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then execute the tests with:

```
pytest tests/
```
